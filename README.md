- dqn_tutor
    - OpenAI officical example on 'CartPole-v0'
    - but it seems hard to converge
- lqn_tutor
    - linear Q-learning network
    - modified from dqn_tutor, convolution netowrk removed
- fcnet
    - TwoLayerNet numpy implementation 
    - from cs231n
- fctorch
    - TwoLayerNet pytorch implementation 
    - from cs231n
    - and also forward network implemented by only numpy
